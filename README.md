# Adaptive Protocol Switching System

**Author:** Syed Shoaib ([LinkedIn](Your LinkedIn URL) | [GitHub](Your GitHub Profile URL))
**Status:** Conceptual Exploration / Proof of Concept

---

## 🧠 Overview

This project presents a conceptual system designed to dynamically switch between REST and gRPC protocols at runtime based on system load. The goal is to reduce infrastructure costs during low-traffic periods by leveraging lighter-weight RESTful instances, and automatically transition to high-performance gRPC instances under heavier loads.

The system is intended as an intelligent, self-optimizing traffic management architecture — ideal for backend-heavy applications with unpredictable or spiky traffic.

---

## ⚙️ Core Idea

The service operates behind an intelligent proxy (e.g., **Envoy**) and routes requests based on current system metrics:

- **Low Traffic Mode:** Routes requests to REST-based instances optimized for cost (e.g., lighter compute, lower idle cost).
- **High Traffic Mode:** Routes to gRPC-based services that are optimized for throughput and performance.
- **Dynamic Switching:** Uses real-time system metrics to decide when to switch. Transitions are gracefully managed to avoid dropped connections or failed requests.

## 🧩 Components Breakdown

- **🧭 Envoy Proxy:** Central router that forwards requests to REST or gRPC backends. Supports dynamic configuration via xDS APIs.
- **📊 Traffic Monitor:** Uses **Prometheus** to collect metrics like CPU usage, RPS (requests/sec), and latency.
- **🧠 Switch Coordinator:** Decision-making agent that compares metrics to defined thresholds and triggers a protocol switch.
- **🧵 Backend Service Pools:**
  - REST Pool: Scales down cheaply during idle time.
  - gRPC Pool: Optimized for speed and efficiency under load.
- **🧰 Optional Buffer/State Layer:** In a real-world version, a **Redis buffer** or similar mechanism may handle in-flight requests or stateful logic during switching.

---

## 🚦 Switching Logic Flow

1. **Monitoring:** Prometheus collects metrics from Envoy and the service pools.
2. **Threshold Evaluation:** Switch Coordinator compares metrics to defined rules (e.g., CPU > 80%, latency > 200ms).
3. **Configuration Change:** If thresholds are breached, it triggers a protocol switch via Envoy’s xDS API.
4. **Graceful Draining:** Envoy begins draining existing connections while forwarding new requests to the new protocol pool.
5. **Retry Logic (Optional):** Clients may see a temporary 503 with `Retry-After`, or retry automatically if using gRPC client libraries.

## 🧠 Key Insights & Trade-offs

|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Operational Complexity**| Significantly more moving parts than traditional autoscaling setups     |
| **Switching Latency**     | Even with xDS, switching takes time and can affect UX (~5-15ms impact)  |
| **Threshold Flapping**    | Systems must avoid constant back-and-forth via hysteresis/delays        |
| **Cost vs. Complexity**   | Autoscaling a single gRPC setup may yield similar or better savings     |
| **Use Case Scope**        | Best for niche scenarios (e.g., predictable heavy spikes, static cost tiers) |

## 💭 Limitations & Future Exploration

- No full-scale deployment or benchmarking conducted — conceptual POC stage.
- Failure modes (e.g., coordinator crash, missed metrics) need better fault-tolerance design.
- Could integrate ML-based predictive switching or reinforcement learning in the future.
- Advanced client SDKs could support protocol hinting, retries, or graceful failover on switch.

---

## ✅ Takeaways

This project showcases how a layered, protocol-aware architecture can dynamically respond to traffic demands for **cost-performance optimization**. It is not necessarily superior to autoscaling but opens the door to creative cloud efficiency strategies. The exercise emphasized:

- Practical trade-off evaluation over theoretical optimization
- Architectural thinking applied to real-world cloud infrastructure
- Systems-level understanding of protocol, routing, and observability tools
